The Child of the Forest is a being designed by Dominus Abyssi to watch over his targets, but they soon became wildly disobedient and were cast away into the Kamfurdam Forest alongside all the other rejects. The Children of the Forest actually have different behaviors and ages based off of their eyes. One eye means they are a baby and will not react to being touched or seen. Two eyes means they are an adult and will alert the Ventriloquist of your presence if seen or approached. Three eyes means they are among the leaders and will try to hunt you down if you get too close or stare at them for too long.",
